## Completed — Round 1

<details>
<summary>P1–P5: 43 items (all completed)</summary>

### P1 — Security & Correctness

- [x] **install.sh: Hardcoded UID 1000:100** — `deploy_repo()` uses `chown -R 1000:100`. Read from `user-settings.nix` `uid` field instead.
- [x] **install.sh: No disk space validation** — EFI + swap + home could exceed disk size, causing confusing `parted` errors. Validate before destructive operations.
- [x] **install.sh: Late `--host` validation** — `--host` value not validated until `resolve_username()`. User goes through disk prompts before learning the host doesn't exist. Validate right after `clone_repo`.
- [x] **ssh-server.nix: Permissive SSH defaults** — `PasswordAuthentication = true` and `AllowUsers = null` (allows all users). Consider key-only default or restrict `AllowUsers` to `userSettings.username`.

### P2 — Robustness & Reliability

- [x] **install.sh: Replace `sleep 2` with `udevadm settle`** — After `partprobe`, use `udevadm settle` for deterministic partition readiness instead of a fixed sleep.
- [x] **install.sh: Add cleanup trap on failure** — If the script fails mid-install, mounts under `/mnt` are left active. Add a trap that runs `umount -R /mnt; swapoff -a` on ERR exit.
- [x] **install.sh: Replace `eval` with `printf -v`** — `prompt_size` and `prompt_disk` use `eval` to set variables by name. `printf -v "$varname" '%s' "$value"` is safer.
- [x] **install.sh: Validate minimum EFI partition size** — A user could specify `--efi-size 1M` which is too small for FAT32. Enforce a minimum.
- [x] **postinstall.sh: Validate hostname matches flake host** — `hostname` could differ from the flake host name. Check `hosts/${HOST}/` exists before `nixos-rebuild`.
- [x] **postinstall.sh: Add `--title` to `gh ssh-key add`** — Won't fix: `gh ssh-key add` already uses the key comment (`${USER}@hostname-date`) as the GitHub title automatically.
- [x] **postinstall.sh: Validate not running as root** — `passwd` and `$HOME` would target the wrong user if run as root.

### P3 — Architecture & Convention

- [x] **Remove unused `mac-app-util` flake input** — Declared in `flake.nix` but never consumed in any module. Adds to `flake.lock` weight and update time.
- [x] **Add `determinate` darwin module to EDGE** — `flake/nixos.nix` includes `determinate.nixosModules.default` for NixOS hosts. `flake/darwin.nix` is missing `determinate.darwinModules.default` for EDGE.
- [x] **Document `plasma-manager` stable-only constraint** — `plasma-manager` follows `nixpkgs-stable` / `home-manager-stable`. If a NixOS host ever uses `channel = "unstable"`, there will be a version mismatch.
- [x] **Make `plasma-manager` conditional on DE** — Currently loaded for all NixOS hosts via `home-manager.sharedModules` regardless of desktop environment. Should be conditional.
- [x] **Remove dead `garbage.nix` import from EDGE** — `hosts/EDGE/configuration/default.nix` imports `garbage.nix` but it can never be enabled (`nix.enable = false`). Remove the import.
- [x] **Use `userSettings.system` for EDGE `hostPlatform`** — `hosts/EDGE/configuration/configuration.nix` hardcodes `"x86_64-darwin"` instead of using `userSettings.system`.
- [x] **Extract duplicated switch aliases to shared module** — `switch`, `switchbuild`, `switchtest`, `switchhealth`, `switchhelp` are copy-pasted across all 3 host `home.nix` files. Extract to a shared module with a platform toggle.
- [x] **Move duplicated `trusted-users` to flake-level builder** — `nix.settings.trusted-users` is identical in both NixOS `user.nix` files. Move to `flake/nixos.nix`.
- [x] **Make repo path configurable** — `~/git/nix-config` is hardcoded in `postinstall.nix`, `aliases.nix` (`switchcd`, `switchupdate`, `switchcheck`). Add a configurable option with this as the default.

### P4 — Module Quality

- [x] **Add comment headers to 13 modules** — Missing purpose + Usage block: `base.nix`, `packages.nix`, `vscode.nix`, `bash.nix`, `brave.nix`, `syncthing.nix`, `thunderbird.nix`, `nextcloud.nix`, `docker.nix`, `mullvad.nix`, `garbage.nix` (shared), `packages.nix` (shared), partial `aliases.nix`.
- [x] **Standardise option prefixes** — All modules now use prefixed naming: `hm*` (home-manager), `sys*` (shared system), `sysDar*` (darwin system), `sysNix*` (NixOS system). Updated all module files, host configs, and documentation.
- [x] **Deduplicate `nil` package** — Removed from `vscode.nix`; kept in `base.nix` where it's available to all hosts.
- [x] **Remove `mpv` from `packages.nix`** — Removed from `packages.nix`; JIN now imports `mpv.nix` module (FENNEC already had it, EDGE uses Homebrew brew).
- [x] **Move Linux-only packages from `all/packages.nix` to `linux/`** — Created `linux/packages.nix` (`custom.hmLinuxPackages`) with 6 Linux-only packages; `all/packages.nix` now only has cross-platform packages.
- [x] **Add platform guard to `vscode.nix` and `nextcloud.nix`** — Moved both from `all/` to `linux/`. macOS hosts use Homebrew casks instead.
- [x] **Move AMD/NVIDIA aliases from `all/` to `linux/`** — Moved `hmAliasesAmdCpu`, `hmAliasesNvidiaGpu`, and `nixdiag` to `linux/aliases.nix`. All use Linux-only commands.
- [x] **Move `cowsay`/`lolcat` out of `base.nix`** — Moved to `all/packages.nix`, then merged `all/packages.nix` into `all/base.nix` (eliminated redundant module). Moved 4 GUI apps (`localsend`, `mullvad-vpn`, `handbrake`, `moonlight-qt`) to `linux/packages.nix` to avoid Homebrew conflicts on macOS.
- [x] **Make `EDITOR` configurable in `base.nix`** — Added `custom.hmBase.editor` option (default `"nano"`). Used by `base.nix` (`EDITOR` env var) and `git.nix` (`core.editor`).
- [x] **Use declarative `programs.thunderbird` in `thunderbird.nix`** — Switched from raw `home.packages` to `programs.thunderbird.enable` with a default profile. Removed commented-out account config. Hunspell dictionaries kept in `home.packages`.
- [x] **Clean up commented-out code** — Removed dead commented-out blocks from 8 files: `vscode.nix` (editor/formatter settings), `sunshine.nix` (preset config), `syncthing.nix` (optional settings), `bash.nix` (`shellOptions`), `nextcloud.nix` (`startInBackground`), `linux/packages.nix` (alt packages), `base.nix` (headsetcontrol variants), `aliases.nix` (dead aliases). Kept deliberate notes with inline explanations.
- [x] **Conditionally enable `plasma-browser-integration` in `brave.nix`** — Auto-detects `desktopEnvironment = "kde-plasma"` from `userSettings` and includes `plasma-browser-integration` in `nativeMessagingHosts`.
- [x] **Add docker group membership to `docker.nix`** — Module now adds the user to the `docker` group automatically via `userSettings.username`. Removed redundant manual entry from JIN's `user.nix`.
- [x] **Add Determinate Nix guard to shared `garbage.nix`** — Auto-disables GC/optimise when `nix.enable = false` (Determinate Nix hosts). Enabling `custom.sysGc` is a safe no-op on those hosts.
- [x] **Add comment for `syncthing.nix` `urAccepted = -1`** — Added inline comment explaining `-1` means opt-out of anonymous usage reporting.

### P5 — Script Polish

- [x] **install.sh: Handle `/tmp/nix-config` collision** — Stale `/tmp/nix-config` from interrupted runs is now removed before cloning. Replaced unreliable `git pull` fallback with delete + fresh clone.
- [x] **install.sh: Add error check after `git clone`** — Added explicit `fatal` message on clone failure instead of relying on cryptic `set -e` exit.
- [x] **install.sh: Gitignore `INSTALL-REPORT.md`** — Already gitignored (`**/INSTALL-REPORT.md` in `.gitignore`).
- [x] **setup.sh: Add timeout to `xcode-select --install` polling** — Added 15-minute timeout (180 iterations × 5s). Exits with a clear error and manual install instructions if timed out.
- [x] **setup.sh: Align clone method with `install.sh`** — Switched from `gh repo clone` (requires auth) to `git clone` with HTTPS URL. Existing repo prompts user before deletion. Added clone failure error check.
- [x] **bash.nix: Remove debug echo** — Won't fix: echos are intentional hook references. All four `programs.bash` hooks (`bashrcExtra`, `initExtra`, `profileExtra`, `logoutExtra`) are covered.
- [x] **JIN `default.nix`: Fix stale `gfxmodeEfi` comment** — Updated value to full resolution chain (`3840x2160,2560x1440,1920x1200,1920x1080,auto`) and fixed comment. Removed stale commented-out line.
- [x] **Move group membership into system modules** — `libvirtd` and `adbusers` auto-added by their modules. Created `embedded.nix` (`custom.sysNixEmbedded`) for `dialout` group + `arduino-ide`. Removed all three from JIN's `user.nix`.

## Round 2

### P1 — Security & Correctness

- [x] **install.sh: Validate extracted USERNAME** — `resolve_username()` now validates `USERNAME` matches `^[a-z_][a-z0-9_-]{0,31}$` (POSIX) and `USER_UID` is in range 1000–65533. Defense-in-depth before values are interpolated into shell paths.
- [x] **install.sh: Add timeout to `udevadm settle`** — Both `udevadm settle` calls now use `--timeout=30` to fail fast on a stuck udev queue instead of hanging silently for 3 minutes.
- [x] **flake/hosts.nix: Assert valid channel value** — `mkHost` now validates `userSettings.channel` is `"stable"` or `"unstable"` and `throw`s a clear error at flake evaluation otherwise. Catches typos before any rebuild starts.

### P2 — Robustness & Reliability

- [x] **install.sh: Validate `nixos-generate-config` output** — `generate_hardware_config()` now fails fast with a clear message if the command fails, the file is empty, or the file is missing `fileSystems` definitions.
- [x] **install.sh: Use `mktemp` for temporary repo** — `clone_repo()` now uses `mktemp -d -t nix-config.XXXXXX` for a unique, race-free path with restrictive permissions. Eliminates symlink attack surface and concurrent-install collisions.
- [x] **setup.sh: Validate Determinate Nix installer download** — Both Determinate Nix and Homebrew installers now use download-then-execute via `mktemp` + `curl -fsSL -o` + non-empty check + trap-based cleanup. Eliminates silent failure when `curl | sh` pipes an empty/partial script.

### P3 — Architecture & Convention

- [x] **Add comment headers to 16 modules** — All 16 modules now have the standard header (purpose + brief explanation + Usage block) matching the existing convention used by `brave.nix`, `hmBash`, etc.
- [x] **Remove unnecessary `lib.mkDefault` on NixOS home.nix** — Dropped `lib.mkDefault` from `home.username` and `home.homeDirectory` in FENNEC and JIN `home.nix`; both now match EDGE's plain assignment. Removed unused `lib` arg.
- [x] **Add section comments to EDGE home-manager imports** — EDGE `home-manager/default.nix` now uses the same `# Host`, `# Base`, `# Shell`, `# Apps`, `# macOS` section comments as FENNEC/JIN, in both the `imports` and `custom.hm*.enable` blocks.
- [x] **Add section comments to EDGE configuration imports** — EDGE `configuration/default.nix` now uses `# Host`, `# Darwin / UI`, `# Darwin / System`, `# Shared` section comments in both the `imports` and `custom.*.enable` blocks.

### P4 — Module Quality

- [x] **Decide host-level module coverage** — Reviewed and confirmed current state is intentional: dev tools (`fnm`, `pyenv`, `ansible`) on JIN + EDGE (dev hosts), absent on FENNEC (gaming/media). Syncthing on FENNEC + JIN via `hmSyncthing`; EDGE uses the `syncthing-app` Homebrew cask per the macOS-GUI-via-cask convention. Per-host `default.nix` is the install manifest.
- [x] **enable-flakes.nix: Clean up stale comments** — Verified: the file already has the standard header (purpose, Determinate Nix note, Usage block). No stale commented-out examples remain. No code change needed.
- [x] **Deduplicate FENNEC/JIN `user.nix`** — Extracted shared user account config to `modules/systems/nixos/system/user.nix` (`custom.sysNixUser.enable` + optional `extraGroups`). Deleted `hosts/FENNEC/configuration/user.nix` and `hosts/JIN/configuration/user.nix`; both hosts now enable the new module from `default.nix`. NIXOS.md updated.
- [x] **Deduplicate FENNEC/JIN `configuration.nix`** — Folded `networking.networkmanager.enable` into `sysNixUser` (paired with the `networkmanager` group). `nixpkgs.config.allowUnfree` was already centralized in `flake/nixos.nix`; `programs.nix-ld` is not used; `system.stateVersion` intentionally stays per-host (locked to first install).

### P5 — Script & Documentation Polish

- [x] **INSTALL.md: Align manual steps with automated script** — Removed duplicate `SWAP_MIB`/`HOME_MIB` variables from Step 0 (now derived from `*_SIZE` via `numfmt`, mirroring `size_mib()` in install.sh). Added `-F` to `mkfs.ext4` and `partprobe` + `udevadm settle --timeout=30` after each parted block, matching the script.
- [x] **README.md: Document channel selection** — Expanded the channel table with the `nix-darwin` input row, added a 'Switching a host's channel' subsection (edit `user-settings.nix` → rebuild), and added a Quickstart pointer noting hosts default to `stable`.
- [x] **setup.sh: Consistent error handling pattern** — Added a `fatal()` helper at the top (matching `install.sh`'s style) and replaced all `|| { echo "...ERROR..."; exit 1; }` blocks and the bare xcode-select `exit 1` with `|| fatal "..."`. Single uniform pattern throughout.

---

## Round 3

### P1 — Security & Correctness

- [x] **setup.sh: `local` keyword incompatible with `#!/bin/sh`** — Switched shebang to `#!/bin/bash` (matches `install.sh`). Resolves the dash incompatibility for the three `local` declarations.

### P2 — Robustness & Reliability

- [x] **EDGE enables `hmAndroid` but adb/scrcpy use is unusual on macOS** — Confirmed intentional: adb/scrcpy are used on EDGE for Android device work. Added an inline comment next to the enable line to document the rationale.
- [x] **`scripts/windows/` directory referenced in README but missing on disk** — Phantom finding: nothing in the actual repo references `scripts/windows/` (the workspace metadata listing it was stale). No code change needed.

### P3 — Architecture & Convention

- [x] **copilot-instructions.md: stale `userSettings` field list** — Updated the Host Wiring section to include `repoPath` (all hosts) and `desktopEnvironment` (optional, e.g. `"kde-plasma"`; consumed via `or null`).
- [x] **copilot-instructions.md contradicts README/HOME-MANAGER.md on `home-manager switch`** — copilot-instructions.md was correct (standalone HM is not wired up since `homeManagerHosts` is empty). Removed misleading `home-manager switch` examples from `README.md` Quick Commands, `HOME-MANAGER.md` (rewrote intro/Switch/How It Works to reflect system-module integration), and `add-host.prompt.md` (per-host README template + flake entry comment). `homeManagerHosts` stays reserved for future non-NixOS/non-darwin hosts.
- [x] **EDGE `user-settings.nix` missing `desktopEnvironment` field** — Added `desktopEnvironment = null; # macOS — DE managed by the OS` so all hosts declare the same schema. Consumers already handle `null` via `or null`.

### P4 — Module Quality

- [x] **`android.nix` lives in `all/` but is Linux/Android-developer focused** — Resolved by Round 3 P2 #1: EDGE confirmed as a genuine consumer (adb/scrcpy used for device work on macOS), so module stays in `all/`. Added a one-line cross-platform note to the module header.
- [x] **`postinstall.nix` doesn't validate `userSettings.repoPath` shape** — Added a `config.assertions` entry requiring `repoPath` to be a non-empty relative string with no leading `/` and no `..` segments. Produces a clear build-time error instead of a silent broken alias.

### P5 — Script & Documentation Polish

- [x] **README.md repository structure: stale module listings** — Added `embedded` to the `nixos/apps/` listing and `user` to the `nixos/system/` listing so README matches the current tree.

## Round 4

### P3 — Architecture & Convention

- [x] **README.md: home-manager module listings under wrong section** — Moved `Nextcloud`, `Packages`, and `VS Code` from the `all/` listing to `linux/` to match actual file locations.

### P4 — Module Quality

- [x] **Vague `mkEnableOption` descriptions across 8 modules** — Rewrote descriptions in brave, bash, ansible, thunderbird, syncthing, nextcloud, vscode, and sunshine to summarise what each module actually configures (matching its header comment).

## Round 5

### P3 — Architecture & Convention

- [x] **`mkEnableOption "enables ..."` prefix violates style guide and produces ungrammatical generated docs (93 modules)** — Stripped the `"enables "` prefix from all 93 modules across `modules/home-manager/` and `modules/systems/` and rewrote each description to summarise what the module configures (matches the header comment). Verified with grep: zero remaining instances.

## Round 6

### P2 — Robustness & Reliability

- [x] **`shutdown-disable-outputs.nix`: enabling with empty `connectors` was a silent no-op and bypassed the KDE assertion** — Split the `config` block: assertions (KDE Plasma + non-empty connectors) now run on `cfg.enable` alone, while the systemd user service still requires connectors. Misconfig now fails at evaluation time instead of silently doing nothing.
