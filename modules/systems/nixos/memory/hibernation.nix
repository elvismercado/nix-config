# Hibernation (suspend-to-disk) support
# https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Hibernate
#
# Hibernation saves the entire contents of RAM to the swap partition
# and powers off the machine. On the next boot, the kernel reads the
# image back from swap and restores the system to its pre-hibernation
# state — all open applications, documents, and sessions intact.
#
# Requirements:
#   - A physical swap partition (NOT zram — zram is RAM-backed)
#   - Swap size ≥ RAM for reliable hibernation (≥ RAM × 1.5 ideal)
#   - The swap partition must be declared in swapDevices (hardware-configuration.nix)
#
# zram interaction:
#   zram swap is ignored during hibernation — the kernel only writes
#   the hibernate image to the physical (disk-backed) swap device.
#   Both coexist safely.
#
# The resume device is auto-derived from swapDevices — the first
# physical (non-zram, non-random-encryption) swap partition is used.
# Override with custom.hibernate.resumeDevice if needed (e.g. swap files).
#
# Usage:
#   imports = [ ../../../modules/systems/nixos/memory/hibernation.nix ];
#   custom.hibernate.enable = true;
